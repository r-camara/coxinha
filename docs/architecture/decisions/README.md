# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs record important architectural decisions. One decision per
file. Lean format (look at any existing ADR as a template).

## Conventions

- Files numbered with 4 digits: `0001-*.md`
- Filename in kebab-case, short
- Never renumber or reuse an ADR number. If a decision is reversed,
  create a new ADR that marks the old one as `Superseded by ADR-NNNN`
- Possible statuses: `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Deprecated`,
  `Superseded by ADR-NNNN`

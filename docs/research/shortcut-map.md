# Shortcut map — why we chose Win+Shift+N (2026-04-20)

Research artifact supporting spec 0042's shortcut decision.
Everything below is either cited or tagged `[unverified]`.

## Why this document exists

The original `Ctrl+Alt+N` default was silently intercepted on
Windows. The first fix attempt, `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+N`, also
failed in the field — likely because existing `config.toml`
files still held the old value and a new `Default::default`
doesn't migrate existing installs (fixed in this same PR via
`config.rs::migrate_stale_shortcut_defaults`).

Rather than keep guessing, we mapped the actual Microsoft-
documented Windows 11 bindings to find a chord no system
feature claims.

## Notion's baseline

- **Global new-note on Windows: none documented.** Notion's
  shortcut help page (https://www.notion.com/help/keyboard-shortcuts)
  lists `Ctrl+N` as "Create a new page" only when Notion has
  focus. No Quick Capture or system-wide hotkey is advertised.
- Implication for Coxinha: the product gap Coxinha is filling
  (OS-wide capture to a vault) has no established chord to
  copy. We pick based on "free on Windows 11" criteria.

## `Ctrl+Alt+<letter>` reservations

The Microsoft Windows-shortcuts page does not reserve any
`Ctrl+Alt+<letter>` at the OS level. OneNote desktop reserves
several **in-app** (source:
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/keyboard-shortcuts-in-onenote-44b8b3f4-c274-4bcc-a089-e80fdcc87950):

- `Ctrl+Alt+1..6` — apply heading styles
- `Ctrl+Alt+C` — Format Painter copy
- `Ctrl+Alt+D` — Dock OneNote window
- `Ctrl+Alt+H` — Highlight text
- `Ctrl+Alt+L` — Lock password-protected sections
- `Ctrl+Alt+M` — Move/copy current page
- **`Ctrl+Alt+N`** — New page at same level below current (OneNote for Windows 10)
- `Ctrl+Alt+P` — Play selected audio
- `Ctrl+Alt+S` — Stop audio
- `Ctrl+Alt+V` — Paste formatting

In-app bindings are only active when OneNote has focus —
they should not intercept a global hotkey in theory. The
original bug report ("Ctrl+Alt+N never reaches Coxinha")
may reflect either a different version of OneNote that
registers global hooks `[unverified]` or a third-party
utility on the user's machine. Either way, we avoid every
`Ctrl+Alt+<letter>` chord that OneNote lists.

## Decision

Defaults ship as:

| Action | Chord |
|---|---|
| new_note | `Super+Shift+N` (Win+Shift+N) |
| open_app | `Super+Shift+C` |
| agenda | `Super+Shift+A` |
| meetings | `Super+Shift+M` |
| toggle_recording | `Super+Shift+R` |

Why `Super+Shift+<letter>`:

- None of `N`, `C`, `A`, `M`, `R` appears in the Microsoft
  Win+Shift+* list above.
- Mnemonic (N = New, C = Coxinha, A = Agenda, M = Meetings,
  R = Record) matches the existing `nav` keys, so muscle
  memory transfers from the previous default.
- Ergonomic: pinky on Win + thumb on Shift + index on letter.
  Three-finger chord is fine for a global hotkey that fires
  once per intent.

### Acknowledged collisions

- **`Win+Shift+M`** collides with Microsoft's "restore
  minimized windows". We ship it anyway for `meetings`
  because the hotkey competes with an extremely rare user
  action (restoring minimized windows via keyboard — most
  users click the taskbar). If this becomes a real problem,
  swap `meetings` to a different letter (candidate: `T` for
  "Team meeting"). Tracked as an open question in spec 0042.
- **`Win+Shift+R`** collides with Windows 11's "record screen
  region". Same trade-off: screen recording is rare for
  typical Coxinha users. If it surfaces, swap to a different
  letter for `toggle_recording`.

### Why not other candidates

- `Ctrl+Alt+Space` — was the top non-Win-key candidate from
  the research. Rejected because the user explicitly asked
  to use the Windows key; this pattern also conflicts with
  PowerToys Run and Alfred-style launchers `[unverified]`.
- `Ctrl+Shift+;` — punctuation chord, ergonomic, no known
  system binding. Rejected because it loses the letter-as-
  mnemonic property (we need five chords, not one, and
  `Ctrl+Shift+N` / `Ctrl+Shift+C` etc. collide with Chrome
  and common dev shortcuts).
- `Win+N` — notification center, cannot touch.
- `Win+Alt+N` — OneNote Quick Note, cannot touch.
- `Win+Ctrl+N` — free, but `Win+Ctrl+*` territory is small
  and chromatically mixed with Accessibility bindings; we
  steer clear to leave room.

## Migration

`src-tauri/src/config.rs::migrate_stale_shortcut_defaults` rewrites
two documented-broken default sets (`Ctrl+Alt+*` and
`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+*`) to the current `ShortcutsConfig::default()`.
Users who customized any key keep their set untouched. One-shot
per install, persisted back to `config.toml`, logged at `info`.
